# Game Design Document (GDD)
## What is it?
A document that describes the essence

(setting, gameplay and its elements, all creatures, and the plot)

that ultimately helps us understand the **idea**!

! - The idea can also be included as the first point, but it's essential to write the document intuitively.

## Why is it needed?
Provides a clear understanding of the game, what it contains, and how to work with it.
Essentially, it's a guide, much like any model of a machine has its "manual" â€“ so does this.

When a new person gets acquainted with the project, they need to quickly and clearly understand what they are dealing with.

## Types of Game Design Documents

A Game Design Document (GDD) is the main document that describes all aspects of the game, including its mechanics, story, characters, levels, interfaces, and other details. There are several types of GDDs, each covering different aspects of game development. Here are the main types of GDDs:

### 1. Main Game Design Document
The primary document covering all aspects of the game. It includes the general concept of the game, its mechanics, story, characters, levels, interface, and other key elements.

### 2. Technical Design Document
Focuses on the technical aspects of the game. It describes the software architecture, technologies to be used, algorithms, data structures, and other technical details.

### 3. Art Design Document
Describes the visual aspects of the game, including style, color palette, character models, locations, animations, and other artistic elements.

### 4. Audio Design Document
Contains information about the game's sound design, including music, sound effects, character voices, and other audio elements.

### 5. Level Design Document
Describes the structure and details of the game levels. It contains information about the placement of objects, tasks to be completed at levels, and other details related to level design.

### 6. User Interface Design Document
Describes the design of the game's user interface, including menus, HUD (Heads-Up Display), settings screens, and other interface elements.

### 7. Script Design Document
Contains a detailed description of the game's plot, dialogues, events, and other elements related to the script.

### 8. Game Mechanics Design Document
Describes all game mechanics, including game rules, physics, interactions between characters, leveling systems, combat systems, and other mechanics.

### 9. Testing Document
Describes the game's testing strategy, including types of testing, testing plans, test cases, and other details related to ensuring the game's quality.

#### **!** - Mainly, documents 1-3 and 5 are used, as mechanics (8) are included in the technical document (2), and the interface in the art document (3).

## Types of GDD Writing Approaches
Here are examples of different approaches to writing Game Design Documents (GDDs): classical, systematic, and one-sheet.

Each has its characteristics and is suitable for different stages of game development or for different project sizes.

### Classical Approach
The Classical GDD is a large and detailed document that covers all aspects of the game. It is ideal for large projects where many details need to be considered.

Example structure of a classical GDD:

#### 1. Introduction
- Brief description of the game
- Game goal
- Target audience
- Platforms
- Game concept

#### 2. Genre
- Gameplay
- Key features

#### 3. Story and Characters
- Main story
- Main characters
- Secondary characters

#### 4. Game Mechanics
- Controls
- Combat system
- Leveling system
- Other mechanics

#### 5. Levels and Environments
- Description of levels
- Maps and locations

#### 6. User Interface
- Menus
- HUD
- Settings

#### 7. Audio
- Sound effects
- Music
- Character voices

#### 8. Art Style
- Visual style
- Models and textures
- Animations

#### 9. Technical Details
- Technologies
- Architecture
- Optimization

#### 10. Testing
- Testing plans
- Test cases

#### **!** - The classical approach is increasingly losing popularity to the "systematic approach".

### Systematic Approach
The Systematic Approach involves creating a GDD divided into separate documents or sections, each describing a specific aspect of the game.

This is suitable for medium-sized projects where modularity and flexibility are needed.

Example of a systematic approach:

#### Main Document:
- General concept
- Target audience
- Platforms

#### Mechanics Document:
- Controls
- Combat system
- Leveling system

#### Story and Characters Document:
- Main story
- Main and secondary characters

#### Levels Document:
- Description of levels
- Maps and locations

#### Interface Document:
- Menus
- HUD
- Settings

#### Audio Document:
- Sound effects
- Music

#### Art Style Document:
- Visual style
- Models and textures

#### **!** - This approach is very convenient with dynamic hyperlinks, everything is structured into separate but related documents.

### One-Sheet
A One-Sheet GDD is suitable for small projects or prototypes and is ideal for **"pitching ideas"**.

It contains only the most important elements of the game, allowing for a quick assessment of the concept.

Example of a One-Sheet GDD:

#### Game Title:

#### Brief Description:
- Short summary of the game, its genre, and main mechanics.

#### Target Audience:
- Age, interests, platforms.

#### Gameplay:
- Main game mechanics.
- Key gameplay elements.

#### Story:
- Main story.
- Main characters.

#### Visual Style:
- Description of the graphic style.
- Key design elements.

#### Audio:
- Type of music and sound effects.

#### Features:
- Unique or key features that set the game apart from others.

#### **!** - The focus here is on gameplay, visual style, and story if it is important, fitting into one, rarely two pages (if there are images or a few reference links).

## What is important now?
Summarizing everything mentioned above, the most important thing is to understand the essence of the **"Systematic Approach"** to writing game documentation and all subsequent GDDs.

Also, pitching ideas or prototypes in the form of a **"One-Sheet"** document.

Mainly, the industry uses the systematic approach where multiple types of documents are used, often combining them, and also creating sub-documents like the "Mechanics" document, which has subtypes "Enemy Mechanics" and "Main Character Mechanics".
