# First Steps
## Git
Learn the information here: [Git](../general/git.md) and here: [Git-LFS](../general/git_lfs.md).  
Complete the courses in the first file (one is enough, but there are more if needed).  
The result of this work should be an understanding of what it is and why it's needed, as well as some practice with your public repository on GitHub.  
This skill is __very__ important for future work.

## Methodologies
Start studying [methodologies](../general/methodology.md) such as Agile, Kanban, and Waterfall.  
The result of this work should be an understanding of project phases and how projects operate.  
This knowledge is crucial for understanding how projects work.

## And now the real challenge

In game development, there are many specialized design roles, each contributing to the creation of the game. Here are some key types of designers in the video game industry:

### Game Designer
Responsible for developing gameplay, rules, and the structure of the game. Game designers create the game's mechanics and help determine how the game will be perceived by players.

### Level Designer
Specializes in creating levels, maps, and environments that players navigate. Level designers develop game spaces that impact the gaming experience.

### UI/UX Designer
Responsible for developing the user interface and ensuring ease of use. These designers create everything related to user interaction with the game, from menus to character status indicators.

### Character Designer
Designs the appearance, clothing, and attributes of game characters. This role requires a deep understanding of the game's style and theme.

### Object Designer
Creates items that players can use or interact with in the game, including weapons, tools, chests, and other assets.

### Sound Designer
Works on the audio aspects of the game, creating sound effects, musical scores, and voiceovers that enhance the game's atmosphere and immersion.

### Quest Designer
Specializes in creating tasks and quests that drive the gameplay and develop the plot.

### Technical Designer
Possesses skills in both design and programming, bridging the gap between game designers and developers by optimizing tools and workflows.

### Game Design Generalist
Often found in small teams or indie projects, generalists wear multiple hats, handling level design, game design, and even aspects of art design.

### Narrative Designer
Responsible for creating the game's story, dialogues, characters, and world. Narrative designers focus on the plot and how it integrates into the game.

Each of these roles plays a unique part in game creation, and depending on the size of the studio and the project, one person may fulfill multiple roles.

## What is needed right now?

### Level Designer
A Level Designer plays a key role in creating video games by designing levels or stages that players navigate. This role requires a deep understanding of both game design and game mechanics to create engaging and functional game spaces.

#### Level Planning:
Level designers start by conceptualizing the level, defining its goals, structure, and main interactive elements. This includes designing the level map, placing key points of interest, and determining player movement paths.

#### Gameplay Design:
Creating mechanics and events within the level that will drive player actions. This may include agility tasks, puzzle solving, combat encounters, and interactive scenes.

#### Working with Development Tools:
Using specialized software tools and game engines (e.g., Unreal Engine, Unity) to create levels. Level designers must be proficient with these tools for modeling, texturing, and lighting the level.

#### Testing and Iteration:
After the initial level design, the testing phase checks playability, balance, and potential bugs. Level designers work closely with testers and other developers to adjust and improve levels.

#### Collaboration with Other Departments:
Level designers work with artists, programmers, sound designers, and writers to ensure levels are not only engaging gameplay-wise but also fit the game's overall aesthetic and narrative.

#### Necessary Skills:
- **Creativity and Visual Imagination:** Important for envisioning how the level will look and function before it's built.
- **Technical Skills:** Knowledge of game engines and 3D modeling software.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Ability to find and fix design issues that may affect the gaming experience.
- **Communication Skills:** Effective communication with team members to share ideas and feedback.
- **Understanding of Game Mechanics and User Experience:** To create levels that are logical, engaging, and evoke emotional responses from players.

Level designers play a central role in game development, as they create the environments where players spend most of their time, significantly influencing the game's reception and enjoyment.

### Game Design Generalist
A Game Design Generalist is a versatile specialist in game development who possesses a broad set of skills and works on various aspects of game creation. Generalists are often found in small studios or indie projects where teams are smaller, and each team member may take on multiple roles.

#### Game Mechanics Design:
Generalists develop and test various game mechanics, ensuring an engaging and enjoyable gameplay experience. They create the rules and systems that define how players interact with the game world.

#### Level Design:
Responsible for creating levels and environments where players spend their time. This includes designing landscapes and level structures and placing elements that impact gameplay.

#### Script and Narrative Work:
Generalists may be involved in creating the plot, dialogues, and characters, integrating narrative elements into the game to enhance immersion and world depth.

#### User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX):
Develop interfaces that are intuitive for players, ensuring easy interaction with the game and accessibility of all necessary functions.

#### Testing and Quality:
Conduct testing at various stages of development to identify bugs and inconsistencies that could affect gameplay and player experience.

#### Necessary Skills:
- **Multidisciplinary Knowledge:** Generalists should have a good understanding of many aspects of game development, including programming, graphic design, sound design, and level design.
- **Creativity and Innovation:** Important for thinking outside the box and proposing original ideas to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Analytical Skills:** Generalists must be able to analyze feedback and game data to optimize and improve the project.
- **Communication Skills:** Effective communication and teamwork are crucial, as generalists often interact with different departments and specialists.
- **Project Management:** Organizing work and managing multiple tasks simultaneously is essential for a generalist.

#### Role in the Team:
In small teams, generalists often act as the "glue" that brings together various aspects of game development. They can lead a project from concept to release, with a deep understanding of each development stage. This makes them invaluable in indie projects and startups where resources and time may be limited.

### UI/UX Designer
A UI/UX Designer in the gaming industry plays a crucial role in creating interfaces and interactions that make the game intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable for users. These designers specialize in developing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), ensuring the game has a high level of usability and engagement.

#### User Interface Design (UI):
Creating all graphical components of the interface, including buttons, icons, menus, and info panels. UI designers ensure that visual elements are not only beautiful but also functional.

#### User Experience Design (UX):
Designing the logic and structure of interactions in the game, including menu navigation, character control, and mechanics for interacting with the game world. UX designers strive to make the gaming process as smooth and understandable as possible for players.

#### Prototyping and Testing:
Developing interface prototypes and conducting user tests to gather feedback. This helps identify and address usability issues before the game hits the market.

#### Collaboration with Developers and Designers:
UI/UX designers work closely with game designers and programmers to ensure the technical feasibility of their ideas and their integration into the game.

#### Adapting Design for Different Platforms:
Considering the specifics of different platforms, whether PC, consoles, or mobile devices, to ensure optimal usability on each of them.

#### Necessary Skills:
