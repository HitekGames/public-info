# First Steps

# Week 1

## Git
Learn the information here: [Git](../../general/git.md) and here: [Git-LFS](../../general/git_lfs.md).  
Complete the courses in the first file (one is enough, but there are more if needed).  
The result of this work should be an understanding of what it is and why it's needed, as well as some practice with your public repository on GitHub.  
This skill is __very__ important for future work.

## Methodologies
Start studying [methodologies](../../general/methodology.md) such as Agile, Kanban, and Waterfall.  
The result of this work should be an understanding of project phases and how projects operate.  
This knowledge is crucial for understanding how projects work.

# Week 1

## Unity
Proceed with the lessons:  
If you start from zero knowledge:  
2 weeks - [Unity Essentials](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials)  
6 weeks - [Junior Programmer](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer)
If you now something - [Middle](leasons.md)  

As you progress, you will need to create games and manage them through Git.  
Try creating new features in separate branches and merging them into the main branch.  
The result of this work should be 3 small and simple games with __different__ mechanics.  
This is necessary for both practice and your future portfolio.  

# Week 2

## Project Access
Access to the project involves working on the first tasks.
