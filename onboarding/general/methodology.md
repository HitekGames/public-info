# What Are These Methodologies?

In video game development, various methodologies are used to organize 
the creation process, manage teams, and ensure effective collaboration among all project participants.

## Brief Overview

### Agile
This methodology focuses on flexibility and iterative development, 
where the development process is divided into short cycles (sprints), 
allowing the team to quickly respond to changes and adapt to new 
requirements. In the gaming industry, Agile allows for effective 
management of development, regularly delivering a working product 
and receiving user feedback.

### Scrum
A variant of Agile, Scrum divides the project into development cycles 
(sprints) that usually last from 2 to 4 weeks. 
Each sprint begins with planning and ends with a review, allowing the 
team to assess the work done and make necessary adjustments. 
Scrum uses roles such as Scrum Master and Product Owner to improve 
the project management process.

### Kanban
Kanban focuses on optimizing workflow and managing task queues. 
In this methodology, teams strive to minimize the amount of work 
in progress, which helps increase project transparency and reduce 
task completion time. This is especially useful in projects that 
require continuous delivery of new content.

### Waterfall
A traditional methodology where the project is developed sequentially 
from start to finish through clearly defined stages. Each stage must 
be completed before starting the next. This methodology can be 
effective for projects with well-defined requirements and constraints 
but is less flexible compared to Agile.
