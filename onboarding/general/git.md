# Git - What You Need to Know

## Basic Understanding of Git

### What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system designed for tracking 
changes in files and coordinating work on those files among multiple 
participants. Git allows you to version files, roll back changes, 
return to previous versions, and collaborate with other developers.

### Why is it needed?

**Version Control:** Tracking the history of code changes, allowing you 
to return to earlier versions and manage different versions of the project.

**Collaboration:** Enabling joint work on projects where multiple developers 
can simultaneously make changes without the risk of data loss.

**Backup:** Storing the history of changes on different machines, 
ensuring data loss protection.

## Understanding Key Git Concepts

**Branches**  
Branches in Git allow developers to work on new features or fixes in 
isolation without affecting the main codebase. This is a fundamental part of 
Git for managing multitasking and dividing the project into logical parts.

**Commits**  
Commits are records of changes to the code. Each commit saves a snapshot of 
all project files at the time of the commit, 
allowing you to return to this state at any time.

**Pull**  
The pull operation is used to fetch and integrate changes from a 
remote repository into the current branch in the local repository. 
This allows you to synchronize your work with changes made by other 
project participants.

**Push**  
Push sends your local changes to the remote repository. 
This makes your changes available to other team members.

**Cloning a Project**  
Cloning creates a local copy of an existing remote repository. 
This is the first step in participating in the development of a 
project that already exists on a remote server.

## Git Skills

### For effective work with Git in this organization, you should be able to:

**Create and Manage Branches:** Understand when and why to create new 
branches, switch between them, and merge changes.

**Make Commits:** Know how to make commits that clearly describe 
the changes made, so the change history is clear and organized.

**Perform Pull and Push Operations:** Synchronize your work with 
that of other developers, send your changes to the server, and receive others'.

**Clone Repositories:** Know how to start working on an existing 
project by cloning a repository.
